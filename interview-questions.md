# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a variable of the function and an argument is the value that is passed through the function.

Researched answer: both are part of a function, a parameter is the name of the variable that is used to refer to the data that is passed through it, an argument is the literal data that is passed through the function

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: All I know is that it must take a function as a parameter...

Researched answer: .map must take a function as a first or only parameter, the function will be applied to every element in the array, the second parameter is only needed when the function uses the "this" keyword. the first parameter is required but the second is only optional

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: a filter removes elements in an array while map creates a new array by modifying the elements in that array

Researched answer: map creates a new array by changing every element in that array, a filter also creates a new array but it does so by removing certain elements from the old array.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: The process that is performed to gather data, calculate data and return data for an array or list

Researched answer: repeating steps or instructions over and over again. usually used in for loops

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: a function is used to return or pass data and a method is used to perform a task.

Researched answer: a function is independent,it is called by its own name, needs to take an input and return an output, performs a task or calculates a value by preforming a set of instructions.
a method is a function stored as object properties, can be linked to any object, it is called by the objects name first, they perform actions on objects

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Im sure it has nothing to do with hoisting a sail right?

Researched answer: hoisting is when the interpreter splits the declaration and assignment of functions and variables. this allows you to use functions and variables before they are declared.
